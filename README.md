Absolutely. Below is a GitHub-style `README.md` document you can use for a repository to guide users through the process of getting Google Play certification using Termux.

## 📱 Google Play Certification (via Termux)

> A step-by-step guide to get your Android device certified on Google Play using Termux.

---

### ⚠️ Disclaimer

This script involves root access. **Only proceed if your device is rooted.** Any misuse is your responsibility.

---

### 🔧 Prerequisites

* Rooted Android device
* Termux installed
* Basic Linux knowledge

---

### 🧠 What This Does

This guide extracts your device's `android_id` using Termux and SQLite, and helps you register it manually on Google's uncertified device portal so your device can pass SafetyNet or get Play Store access.

---

### 🚀 Steps

#### 1. Install SQLite in Termux

```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade
pkg install sqlite
```

#### 2. Get Your Android ID

```bash
su -c "sqlite3 /data/data/com.google.android.gms/databases/gservices.db \"SELECT value FROM main WHERE name = 'android_id';\""
```

> 📋 Copy the result. This is your `android_id`.

---

#### 3. Register on Google

* Go to: [https://www.google.com/android/uncertified](https://www.google.com/android/uncertified)
* Sign in with your Google account.
* Paste your `android_id` and register.

---

#### 4. Clear Google Play & Play Services Cache

```bash
su -c "pm clear com.android.vending && pm clear com.google.android.gms && reboot"
```

---

### ✅ You're Done

Once your device reboots, give Google a few minutes to process the certification. You can verify Play certification in:

> Google Play Store → Settings → Play Protect certification

---

### 💡 Tip

If you still see "Device is not certified," try re-adding your Google account after a few hours.
